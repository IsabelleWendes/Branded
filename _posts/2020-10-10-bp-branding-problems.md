The British Petroleum Company PLC, otherwise known as BP, is one of the world's seven oil and gas "supermajors". Basically, one of the biggest oil companies in the world. I'm sure you've heard of them and if you haven't, I have no doubt that you will have seen their rather prominent logo around and about. You will often find it on the side of lorries or at a petrol station.

I want you to imagine that you are looking at this logo for the first time with no context as to what this company does. What do you see? What do you think this company produces and values? Here are my thoughts: 

Firstly, I want to look closer at the letters bp.

 These letters are written in the typeface Univers 55 Roman.

The typeface is characterised by its sans-serif, regular width, regular weight, not hugely distinct contrast in thickness and marginally shorter ascenders and descenders. Altogether I would describe Univers 55 Roman as a pretty regular font. There is no exotic or stand out flair to it. It is simple, subtle and not a font I would necessarily pair with a company like bp. My reason for this is my association with an oil company would be big machinery, loud and in your face, and this typeface is the complete opposite of that. 

Secondly, the main colour of the logo as a whole is green.
